## What is Cloud Computing? 
Cloud Computing is a model for delivering various computing services over the internet, allowing users to access and use resources such as storage, servers, databases, software, and more, without the need for on-premises infrastructure. 
It offers flexibility, scalability, cost-effectiveness, and ease of management.

## Quick history/timeline of Cloud Computing.
- 1960s: The concept of utility computing was introduced, where computing resources could be shared remotely.
- 1990s: Telecommunications companies started offering Virtual Private Network (VPN) services.
- 2006: Amazon Web Services (AWS) launched its Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) service, marking the beginning of modern Cloud Computing.
- 2008: Google launched Google App Engine, providing a platform for building and hosting web applications.
- 2010: Microsoft introduced Azure, its Cloud Computing platform.
- Present: Cloud Computing has become mainstream, with numerous providers offering a wide range of services.

## What can you do with Cloud Computing?
With Cloud Computing, you can:

- Store and access data remotely.
- Run applications and software without the need for on-premises infrastructure.
- Scale resources up or down based on demand.
- Collaborate and share data easily.
- Backup and recover data efficiently.


## What is “On-Prem”?
"On-Prem" refers to the traditional approach of hosting and managing computing resources on-premises, within an organization's own data centers. It involves purchasing, maintaining, and upgrading hardware and software infrastructure.

## What are the 4 TYPES of Cloud?
The 4 TYPES of Cloud are:

1. Public Cloud: Infrastructure and services are owned and operated by a third-party Cloud Provider and made available to the public over the internet.
2. Private Cloud: Infrastructure and services are dedicated to a single organization and may be managed by the organization itself or a third-party provider.
3. Hybrid Cloud: Combination of public and private clouds, allowing data and applications to be shared between them.
4. Multi-Cloud: Utilizing multiple cloud providers to meet specific needs, taking advantage of different services and avoiding vendor lock-in.

## What are the different types of cloud SERVICE?
- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): Provides virtualized computing resources, such as virtual machines, storage, and networks.
- Platform as a Service (PaaS): Offers a platform for developing, running, and managing applications, without the need to manage underlying infrastructure.
- Software as a Service (SaaS): Delivers software applications over the internet, accessible through a web browser. 

## Advantages/Disadvantages of the Cloud? Specifically for a business.
Advantages of the Cloud for businesses:

- Scalability: Easily scale resources up or down based on demand.
- Cost-effectiveness: Pay only for what you use, with no upfront hardware costs.
- Flexibility: Access resources and data from anywhere, at any time.
- Reliability: Cloud providers offer robust infrastructure with high availability and redundancy.

Disadvantages of the Cloud for businesses:

- Dependency on internet connectivity.
- Potential data privacy and security concerns.
- Limited control over underlying infrastructure.
- Potential vendor lock-in if not using multi-cloud strategies.

## What is OpEx bs CapEx?
OpEx (Operational Expenditure) and CapEx (Capital Expenditure) refer to different financial models:

- OpEx: Operating expenses incurred as ongoing costs, such as subscription fees or usage-based charges in the Cloud.
- CapEx: Capital expenses incurred as upfront investments in assets, such as purchasing servers or data center infrastructure.


## What are the 3 largest Cloud providers know for (What makes them popular?)
The three largest Cloud providers are:

1. Amazon Web Services (AWS): Known for its broad range of services, scalability, and market dominance.
2. Microsoft Azure: Known for its integration with Microsoft products and services, hybrid cloud capabilities, and enterprise focus.
3. Google Cloud Platform (GCP): Known for its strong data analytics and machine learning capabilities. 

## What are the 4 pillars of DevOps? How do they link into the Cloud do you think?
The 4 pillars of DevOps are:

1. Culture: Encourages collaboration, communication, and shared responsibility between development and operations teams.
2. Automation: Automates repetitive tasks, builds, testing, and deployment processes to enhance efficiency and reduce errors.
3. Measurement: Collects data and metrics to gain insights and improve performance throughout the development and operations lifecycle.
4. Sharing: Promotes knowledge sharing, learning, and continuous improvement across teams.
DevOps and Cloud Computing are closely linked as Cloud Computing provides the infrastructure and tools necessary for implementing DevOps practices.
